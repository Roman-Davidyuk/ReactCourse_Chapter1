 **Detailed Description:**

Without **`ToDoListContainer`** and **`Header`**, the React component tree becomes flatter and simpler.
The **`App`** component now directly handles all state logic and renders the main components for task management.

- **`App`**:
  - Manages the state for the task list (`toDos`) and the search query (`filterText`).
  - Passes down the `searchValue` and `onSearch` callback to `SearchBar` to handle filtering.
  - Provides `onAddToDo` to `AddToDoForm` to handle task creation.
  - Filters tasks based on `filterText` and passes the filtered list to `ToDoList`, along with methods for toggling and deleting tasks.

- **`SearchBar`**:
  - A controlled input field that takes `searchValue` from `App` as its value and calls `onSearch` to update the search query in `App`.

- **`AddToDoForm`**:
  - A form that accepts new task titles. It manages its own input state and calls `onAddToDo` to pass the new task back to `App`.

- **`ToDoList`**:
  - Receives the filtered task list (`toDos`) and renders each task via the `ToDoItem` component. Also passes `onToggleComplete` and `onDeleteToDo` to `ToDoItem`.

- **`ToDoItem`**:
  - Displays an individual task, allowing users to mark it as complete or delete it by using the provided props from `ToDoList` (`onToggleComplete` and `onDeleteToDo`).

By removing `ToDoListContainer`, all state management is done directly in `App`, leading to a more streamlined but less modular structure.
